\chapter{Conclusion}\label{Conclusion}

<this research has been a first effort to create a distributed ech deployment model>
<we have seen background>
<we have seen design>
<we have seen implementation>
<we have seen results>

<in this final chapter, present key learnings>
<then outline future work>
<finish with a reflection of the project as a whole>









\section{Learnings}

<ECH Split Mode topology permits distributed deployment>
<https rr enable static load distribution>
<A dynamic DNS service allows for fair load distribution>
<minimal performance impact when compared to normal>
<security is ok and techniques exist to defend against correlation attacks>









\section{Future Work}

<shared dns publication strategy (with ech key rotation)>
<dynamic traffic flow analysis for load balancing (instead of just distribution)>
<more in-depth study on disrupting traffic correlation attacks>
<test deployment on actual hardware with realistic traffic>








\section{Reflection}

<what i think went well>
<reliable, reproducable and deterministic virtual environment test bed>
<functioning distributed ech prototype>
<if i was to do this again, what would i change>
<dedicate more time to theoretical instead of practical (e.g. got firefox working but unsure if actually compatible with spec>
<however, the work completed is still applicable to future effort>
