This work has been completed under the guidance and persistence of Dr. Stephen Farrell, without which I cannot say there would be much of a paper to speak of. His continued efforts on the implementation of Encrypted Client Hello within OpenSSL and related work as part of the DEfO project has been fundamental to my research. Thank you.
