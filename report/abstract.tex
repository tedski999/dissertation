\begin{spacing}{1} \noindent
Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) is a proposed extension to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol that mitigates the current exposure of private connection information, and has begun to see implementation and adoption on the Internet. However, standard deployment strategies encourage placing many TLS servers behind a single ECH-service provider to form an anonymity set, which introduces significant network centralisation and limits the types of environments the extension can be operated in.

This report presents a method for distributing the deployment of ECH among a loose network of co-operating TLS servers such that each server is an ECH-service provider for all others. The effectiveness of this solution is evaluated based on its privacy and security implications, impact to overall network performance and ability to fairly allocate load between participating servers over time.
